/**
 * Arabic letters in their joined forms, for the one place that draws text
 * without a shaping engine of its own (the preview-card renderer).
 *
 * That renderer measures a word letter by letter, as if nothing joined, and
 * then draws it joined: the box comes out wider than the word and every gap
 * between words is too big. Writing each letter as the contextual form it
 * would take (Unicode "Arabic Presentation Forms-B") leaves nothing to shape,
 * so what it measures is what it draws.
 *
 * The renderer then draws such letters in the order given, left to right, so
 * the word comes back already reversed, the way it reads on screen.
 *
 * Letters outside this table (Persian, Urdu) are passed through unchanged.
 * Diacritics are dropped: they would sit on the wrong glyph once the letters
 * are replaced, and headlines do not carry them.
